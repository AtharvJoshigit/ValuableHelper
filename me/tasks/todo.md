# Project Sync Plan
- [ ] Review current project structure and compare with `me/system/overview.md`.
- [ ] Update `me/system/overview.md` to reflect actual file locations (e.g., `tele_bot` is in `src/tools/tele_bot`).
- [ ] Sync project status by updating the task lists and documentation.
- [ ] Verify all paths mentioned in documentation exist.
