2. **research_general**: Conduct comprehensive research on any topic. Returns detailed, well-structured research reports.

3. **research_trends**: Analyze current trends and developments. Focuses on what's trending now and future predictions.

4. **daily_research_digest**: Generate comprehensive daily research digests covering multiple categories.
